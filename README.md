# Text Files

In addition to the source codes, there are several text files,
System_Report.txt is the output and others are inputs.

1- topology_matrix.txt : As the name suggest it is topology matrix of our sdf (each line
represents an edge and each column represents an operator)

2- marking_vector.txt : this file indicates us the initial number of token existing in our system

3- actor_process_times.txt : this file shows The processing time of each operator
(all should be in 1 line separated by a ",")

4- finally you can see the image of our graph thanks to igraph library!!
